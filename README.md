# Shopify
This is an Open Sourced E-Commerce App. I started this as an ITI project but now it will evolve to full size Shopping App. This repository holds basic E-commerce . You can download the [demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1rM7l_9hqGKgiVDaXtgWmiDF-8jV0Izqr/view?usp=sharing) to see what it looks like now..
this app has nothing to do with shopify app I just created for educational purpose.
